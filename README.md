# Improved Murderous Rage

## Description
Improved Murderous Rage enhances the vanilla murderous rage mental break in RimWorld. With this mod, pawns will now target individuals they have the lowest opinion of, adding depth to the mental break events. The mod introduces a delay before the pawn starts the murder, allowing players to intervene. Pawns can use both melee and ranged weapons in their rampage.

## Features
- **Target Selection:** Pawns in a murderous rage will target other pawns they dislike the most.
- **Weapon Use:** Pawns will use any available weapon, be it melee or ranged, in their attack.
- **Preparation Time:** Adds a timer before the pawn starts their attack, giving players time to respond to the situation.
